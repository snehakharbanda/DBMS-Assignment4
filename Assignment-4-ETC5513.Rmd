The motive of this section is to find out the **best defender** in Laliga (Spanish football league), season 2019-2020 according to player stats. We will be analyzing different variables to get the best defender out of the 20 teams. 

```{r}
defender <- La_liga_data %>%
  filter(Position == "Defender") %>%
  select(Team, Name, Percentage.of.games.played, Yellow.Cards, Goals.conceded.while.player.on.pitch,
         Interceptions, Recoveries, Clearances, Successful.tackles, Unssuccessful.tackles,
         Fouls.committed, Successful.duels, Duels.lost, Successful.aerial.challenges,
         Unsuccessful.aerial.challenges, Fouls.committed.per.card )
