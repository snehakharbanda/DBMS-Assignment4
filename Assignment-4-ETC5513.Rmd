  select(Team, Name, Games.played, Yellow.Cards, Goals.scored, Penalties.scored, Successful.tackles, Recoveries, Successful.duels, Assists) %>%
  rename("Games_played" = Games.played,
         "Yellow_cards" = Yellow.Cards,
         "Goals_scored" = Goals.scored,
         "Penalties_scored" = Penalties.scored,
